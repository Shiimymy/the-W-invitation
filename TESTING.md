## Fixed issues

| Register and Sign out pages not working | IDE was auto formatting on save those pages which broke Django logic | Disabled auto formatting and rewritted the code as per Django logic |
| Inconsistent filter design | Filters were not rendering properly | Updated CCS to match the website design |
